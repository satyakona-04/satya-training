See, we have this crazy, thrill-seeking goal to climb from a small company
 that has quadrupled in size in just four years to one of the top 5 most-visited
 custom design t-shirt and apparel sites. And we aspire to reach our traffic target in the next year.

Our e-commerce model lets shoppers design and upload their own t-shirt art for
 imprinting, and have the finished product shipped to their doorstep in a few days. 
 We’ve been successful beyond our wildest projections and now need to move our existing legacy 
datacenter to the cloud to handle an avalanche of orders.

You could be the one to take us to the top. We need a DevOps engineer with strong Amazon 
Web Services experience. You will create cloud formation templates to build AWS services
 that support our custom Java application. You’ll need to build the whole stack ELBs to 
 databases, and then move and launch our site at its new home. And you’ll need to help guide
 us through this process in a pretty short outage window.

In this role, you’ll work collaboratively with software engineering to deploy and operate
our systems. Help automate and streamline our operations and processes. Build and maintain 
tools for deployment, monitoring and operations. And troubleshoot and resolve issues in our dev, 
test and production environments.
