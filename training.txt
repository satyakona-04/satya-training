Build automation tools are part of the software development lifecycle where source code is compiled into machine code by a build script. Once the code is completed it is integrated into a shared environment. There it interacts with other software components built by 
other developers. Before the code is integrated steps are taken to ensure the new code does not negatively impact other developers’ work within the development team.


Typically build automation is completed with a scripting language that 
enables the developer to link modules and processes within the compilation process. This scripting encompasses several tasks including documentation, testing, compilation, and distribution of the binary software code.
